# Social Game Project Status

## Project Overview
A full-stack social media platform with gamification elements, built using:
- Frontend: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: ASP.NET Core 8.0

## Current Progress

### Completed
1. Project Structure Setup
   - Created React frontend with TypeScript
   - Set up ASP.NET Core backend
   - Configured Tailwind CSS
   - Set up Redux store for state management

2. Authentication System
   - Implemented basic registration and login UI
   - Created authentication endpoints in the backend
   - Set up CORS for frontend-backend communication
   - Added basic error handling

### In Progress
1. Backend Issues to Fix
   - Missing Comment and Like models (causing build errors)
   - Need to implement proper password hashing
   - Need to implement JWT token generation
   - Need to add proper user data persistence

2. Frontend Features
   - Basic authentication flow is working
   - Need to implement protected routes
   - Need to add form validation
   - Need to improve error handling

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Fix Backend Build Errors
   - Create Comment and Like models
   - Implement proper data relationships
   - Set up database context

2. Enhance Authentication
   - Implement proper password hashing
   - Add JWT token generation
   - Set up user data persistence
   - Add email verification

3. Frontend Improvements
   - Add form validation
   - Implement protected routes
   - Add loading states
   - Improve error messages

### Future Features

## Current Issues
1. Backend build errors due to missing models
2. Basic authentication is working but needs security improvements
3. No data persistence yet
4. Frontend needs better error handling and validation

## Development Environment
- Frontend runs on: http://localhost:3000
- Backend runs on: http://localhost:5020
- API Documentation: http://localhost:5020/swagger

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Run backend:
   ```bash
   cd SocialGame.API
   dotnet run
   ```
3. Run frontend:
   ```bash
   cd social-game-client
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Notes for New Developers
- The project uses TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling
- Redux Toolkit is used for state management
- The backend follows REST API principles
- Authentication is currently using a basic implementation that needs to be enhanced
